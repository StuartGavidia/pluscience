The attractive forces that exist between molecules are called intermolecular forces because they span from one molecule to another. We will use the intermolecular forces between molecules to understand why some are merely gases, others are liquids, and some are downright solid!  We'll apply what we know about intermolecular forces to understand the viscosity and surface tension of liquids. In the end of this chapter, we'll learn how to describe phase changes and use phase diagrams to keep track of which phase of matter each substance is in when pressure and temperature are taken into account.",

                    background: "In this chapter, we'll build on our newfound knowledge of acid-base chemistry and apply it to three very important and related topics. First, much of the chemistry in your body is BUFFERED when weak acids are combined by their conjugate bases in solution. When both are present together, they buffer the solution so that large changes in pH don't occur as acid or base are added to the solution. In this way, your blood is able to absorb acid or base without throwing the pH of your blood outside its normal range (aka, you don't die by drinking something acidic like lemonade). Second, whenever acids are added to bases, an equivalent number of moles of base are neutralized. Chemists use TITRATIONS like this to determine the unknown concentration of either the acid or the base if they know the concentration and volume of the titrant (the solution being added) and the volume of the solution that is being titrated.  This is a helpful trick that chemists use to know how concentrated a solution is. Third, the concept of an equilibrium constant (K) is the basis for understanding the SOLUBILITY PRODUCT (Ksp), which allows chemists to calculate the concentration of even the most insoluble substances in water.",
