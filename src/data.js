The attractive forces that exist between molecules are called intermolecular forces because they span from one molecule to another. We will use the intermolecular forces between molecules to understand why some are merely gases, others are liquids, and some are downright solid!  We'll apply what we know about intermolecular forces to understand the viscosity and surface tension of liquids. In the end of this chapter, we'll learn how to describe phase changes and use phase diagrams to keep track of which phase of matter each substance is in when pressure and temperature are taken into account.",

Some reactions just naturally take a long time...as in millions of years (hear that shoutout to Geosciences?).  Some reactions are literally explosive. There is literally a science to this field, and we'll use it to figure out how quickly a reaction will happen based on things like concentration and temperature. ",

Chemists describe this chemical indecision as an equilibrium and have come up with mathematical constants that describe the extent that the reactions proceed in the forward direction. Equilibrium constants greater than 1 tell a chemist that the reaction prefers to form products and vice versa for equilibrium constants less than 1. By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to write algebraic expressions for equilibrium constants, even for reactions in which there are a mixture of different chemical phases present; to calculate the value of equilibrium constants, and to predict which way any reaction will proceed. When reactions aren't at equilibrium, they shift direction to eventually be at equilibrium according to Le Ch√¢telier's Principle.",

                    background: "In this chapter, we'll build on our newfound knowledge of acid-base chemistry and apply it to three very important and related topics. First, much of the chemistry in your body is BUFFERED when weak acids are combined by their conjugate bases in solution. When both are present together, they buffer the solution so that large changes in pH don't occur as acid or base are added to the solution. In this way, your blood is able to absorb acid or base without throwing the pH of your blood outside its normal range (aka, you don't die by drinking something acidic like lemonade). Second, whenever acids are added to bases, an equivalent number of moles of base are neutralized. Chemists use TITRATIONS like this to determine the unknown concentration of either the acid or the base if they know the concentration and volume of the titrant (the solution being added) and the volume of the solution that is being titrated.  This is a helpful trick that chemists use to know how concentrated a solution is. Third, the concept of an equilibrium constant (K) is the basis for understanding the SOLUBILITY PRODUCT (Ksp), which allows chemists to calculate the concentration of even the most insoluble substances in water.",
